Expectation
    multiply the payoff for each possibility with the probability of that thing happening

Variance 
    a measure of how spread out values are
    sum of the squared distances between each element in the set and the expected value of the set
    square root of variance is Standard Deviation

Covariance 
a measure of how dependent two variables are in the statistical sense
if two variables are Independent the the covariance is 0 (uncorrelated)
if they both increase and decrease at tthe same time then the covariance is positive and if one goes up while the other goes down it's negative
