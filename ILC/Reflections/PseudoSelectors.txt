1. My goal is to obtain the Responsive Web Design Certification from Freecodecamp.org
2. I finished a module that covered CSS pseudo selectors, SVG icons, CSS positioning and media queries. The project for this module was to build a technical documentation page using all the skill I've learned thus far
3. I learned how to specify different styles for different devices, and how to utilize SVG vector graphics in my website. I learned some more intermediate CSS techniques
