1. Use Bayes’ rule to solve the following problem: At a party you meet a person who claims to have been to the same school as you. You vaguely recognise them, but 
can’t remember properly, so decide to work out how likely it is, given that:

• 1 in 2 of the people you vaguely recognise went to school with you
• 1 in 10 of the people at the party went to school with you
• 1 in 5 people at the party you vaguely recognise

hypothesis: the person wnet to the same school as you
data: vaguely recognizing the person

P(B | A) = 1/2
P(A) = 1/10
P(B | not A) = 1/5

P(B) = P(B|A) * P(A) + P(B | not A) * P(not A)
= 1/2 *1/10 + 1/5 *9/10
=7/50

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A)/P(B)
=(1/2)*(1/10) /7/50
=5/7

there is a 5 in 7 chance you went to the same school
